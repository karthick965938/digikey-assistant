For more information about DigiKey, please see the "About DigiKey" section of our website.

What personal information does DigiKey collect and why?
The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories:

Information that you provide voluntarily
We may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily through our website functionality or services we provide. For example, we may ask you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with us, to fulfil an order you place with us, to subscribe to our newsletters or other marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us. We collect information you provide when you enter a contest, sweepstakes, or other promotion; when you request stock notifications and product availability information; when you complete a survey, when you sign up for a webinar, or when you send us an email or feedback. We also collect your credit card or other financial details when you make a purchase with us.

If you leave comments on the website, information associated with that comment, such as your username and the time of the post, may be saved. Information is also collected from our online customer support chat service (such as your chat login details or other personal information and chat communications, which we monitor for quality assurance purposes). Chat communications are recorded and use third-party cookies and DigiKey’s chat service provider may have access to or store chat communications and related information.

If the website allows users to publicly post submissions and you decide to publicly post a submission to appear on the website, your name may appear on the website in connection with your submission.

The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information (unless it is obvious from the context).

Information that we collect automatically
We and our third party service providers or partners may collect certain information automatically from your device when you visit our website or use any services we provide. In some states and countries, including countries in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom ("UK"), this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.

Specifically, the information automatically collected may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, operating system, date and time of visit, referring website or website you visit after our website, the search engine queries used to get to our website, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location), and other technical information. It may also include information about how your device has interacted with our website, including the pages accessed, products viewed, search terms used, and links clicked. We also collect information related to your use of the website, such as your site usage information, transaction information including whether a KYC check was completed (if applicable), site communication information, account activity information, other web usage activity logged by our web servers, and whether you open an email and your interactions with email content, access times, error logs, and other similar information.

Collecting this information provides a better understanding of the visitors who come to our website, where they come from, and what content on our website is of interest to them. This information is used for our internal analytics purposes, to improve the quality and relevance of our website and services to our visitors, and to enhance the security of our website. We also use this information for detection and prevention of fraud, security threats or other illegal or suspicious behaviour on our website.

Some of this information is necessary for the proper functioning of the website and may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading "Cookies and similar tracking technology" below.

In addition to collecting personal information for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, we may use personal information for other compatible purposes including, without limitation, anonymizing or de-identifying data (anonymization or de-identification may be done by DigiKey or its service providers). To the extent we anonymize or de-identify data, we will not attempt to re-identify such data.

Information that we obtain from third party sources
Our website may contain links to third party websites, embedded content that comes from or relates to third party websites and services, and buttons from third party websites and services (such as social media sharing buttons). From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources.

These third party sources may include, but are not limited to, suppliers, third party web analytics services, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram. The types of information we may receive from these third parties includes information on your web activity about how you interact with our website and their services and aggregated analytics. We use this information to help improve our website and services, provide information and advertising, and to be able to analyze aggregate click statistics and trends. We may also obtain aggregated information, including analytical results, about your use of the website for fraud detection, prevention and reporting purposes.

Who does DigiKey share my personal information with?
We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:

to our related companies and third party suppliers, manufacturer representatives, partners and services providers For example, we may disclose personal information to a supplier, manufacturer representative, or service provider to support the delivery or drop shipment of products ordered, for order fulfillment purposes, for purposes of securing pricing, working with customers on design registration, assessing product availability, and other issues concerning products, to provide functionality on, or help to enhance our services or the security of our website, to provide advertising services and web analytics, for order fulfilment or market research purposes, or to a third party who assists us with a contest, sweepstakes, other promotions, surveys, or webinars. We also may disclose personal information to those who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information. For example, we utilize services by our third party partners and service providers to enable the detection of devices connected with fraud and other types of information security vulnerabilities to enhance security on our website and other pages on the internet. This includes disclosure of data to third party Sift who provide services for detection and prevention of fraud, security threats or other illegal or malicious behavior or for managing disputes.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.

We may also collect or otherwise gather information related to you from these third-party service providers. These third-party service providers may collect, store, and share information as further dictated by the privacy policies of those third parties

Google, Inc., may utilize the data collected to track and examine the use of our website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google, Inc. services. Google, Inc. may also use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network to serve ads to you based on your visit to our website and other sites on the Internet.

How does DigiKey keep my personal information secure?
We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you. The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information. In particular, DigiKey's website is equipped with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Online orders to DigiKey can only be placed from a browser that supports SSL. Where this is the case, your browser will automatically enter a secure mode when you make purchases. If your browser does not support SSL or you would like to place orders using a method other than the website, please review the Ordering FAQs for alternative ordering methods.

If you would like to report a concern about our website, please email us at security@digikey.com.

International data transfers
Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective.

Specifically, our website servers are located in USA, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing the European Commission's or the UK Standard Contractual Clauses where appropriate, which can be provided on request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can also be provided upon request.

Data retention
The length of time we retain personal information will be determined based upon criteria such as: the length of time your personal information remains relevant; the length of time it is reasonable to keep records to demonstrate that we have fulfilled our duties and obligations; any limitation periods within which claims might be made; any retention periods prescribed by law or recommended by regulators; or the type of contract we have with you, the existence of your consent, and our legitimate interest or business need in keeping such information (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, compliance, or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Automated decision-making
In some instances, our use of your personal information may result in automated decisions being taken that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you.

Automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without our human review. For example, we use automated decisions to protect against fraudulent transactions. We have implemented measures to safeguard the rights and interests of individuals whose personal information is subject to automated decision-making, including limiting the use of automated procedures to fraud detection and providing a means to contact DigiKey if needed.

When we make an automated decision about you, you may request a human review of the decision. You can exercise this right by contacting us using the details provided in this notice.

Your data protection rights
You have the following data protection rights:

If you wish to access, confirm our processing of, correct, update, or request deletion or anonymization of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the "How to contact us" heading below.
In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the "How to contact us" heading below.
You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the "unsubscribe" or "opt-out" link in the marketing e-mails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the "How to contact us" heading below.
Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area are available here.
We respond to all requests we receive from individuals, or their authorized representatives if permitted by applicable law, wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

Third party websites
The DigiKey website may contain links to other websites. DigiKey cannot take responsibility for personal information collected on these third party websites, nor does DigiKey monitor or accept responsibility for the accuracy or content of these other websites.
