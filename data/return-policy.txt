What is DigiKeyâ€™s return policy?
DigiKey requires that customers first obtain an RMA (Returned Merchandise Authorization) number prior to returning any products. Returns must be made within 60 days of the date of invoice, be in the original packaging and be in resalable condition.

At the time of quoting or the time of purchase, a product may say that it is Non-Cancelable/Non-Returnable (NCNR). These products are not returnable.
