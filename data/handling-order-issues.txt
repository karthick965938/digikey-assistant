Return authorization and shipping label

For returns in the United States, a return label will be provided for a charge of $7.50 or you can return the package at your own expense.
For returns shipping to DigiKey from outside of the United States, a return label will be provided for a fee. The label fee will depend on the country you are shipping from and will be displayed before you confirm your return request.
