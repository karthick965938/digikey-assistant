How do I pay by prepaid wire transfer?
In the checkout, click “Payment in Advance by Wire Transfer.” When you submit your online order, an email will be sent to the address we have on file with a proforma invoice and information to complete the purchase process. DigiKey does not charge a processing fee for prepaid wire transfers, but your bank or an intermediary bank may have a fee.

DigiKey will never contact you to collect personal information like passwords and social security numbers. We will only provide proforma payment information if you contact us and initiate a purchase. If you suspect fraud, please contact our customer support team at india.support@digikey.com.
