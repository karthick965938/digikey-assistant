DigiKey Voice Bot - Interactive Office Assistant using Generative AI(Open AI)

Project Idea: DigiKey Voice-Activated Office Assistant
I am going to develop a voice-activated assistant for the DigiKey website( https://www.digikey.in ) using the Maixduino Kit and Generative AI technologies. This assistant will help users interact with DigiKey’s site more efficiently by answering their questions and providing useful information.

What is the DigiKey Office Assistant?
The DigiKey Office Assistant is a voice-based chatbot designed to:

1) Answer questions about basic info and services on DigiKey’s( https://www.digikey.in ) website.
2) Act like a virtual receptionist to assist users.

You can listen to a sample conversation with the assistant here → https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jQ5SCLSKgzAC2kIog-dP9q7zvZhEPmPL/view?usp=sharing

How Does the DigiKey Office Assistant Work?
The assistant has two main components:

Generative AI:

1) Collects information from DigiKey’s website( https://www.digikey.in ).
2) Converts this data into a format that can be used to answer user questions (known as vectordb).

IoT (Internet of Things):

1) The Maixduino Kit captures the user’s voice through a microphone, converts it to text, and sends it to vectordb.
2) Vectordb provides suggestions based on the data and sends them to the OpenAI API.
3) The OpenAI API generates a response, which is then converted from text to speech.
4) The Maixduino Kit outputs the response through a speaker and displays it on a screen.

Why Use the Maixduino Kit?
The Maixduino Kit is a great choice because it offers:

1) Wi-Fi Connectivity: Allows communication between the user and the OpenAI API.
2) Display Module: Provides a user-friendly interface to show information and responses.

By using these features, the DigiKey Office Assistant will provide a smooth and interactive experience for users.
