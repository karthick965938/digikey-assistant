Why has my order been delayed?
There are several possible reasons for a shipping delay, including:

The order is being held for further review for export compliance
The order contains value-added items or other customer requirements (such as date code, continuous strip, quality clauses, etc.) that require additional processing time
Our couriers are experiencing inclement weather delays. If we have delays in shipping your package due to weather, a notice will be posted on the DigiKey website at time of order and you will receive an email that your shipment was delayed.
